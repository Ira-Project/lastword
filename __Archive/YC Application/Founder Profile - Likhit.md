I travel frequently between USA and India and it's always a challenge to find flight tickets at a reasonable price. My hometown Bhubaneswar is a tier 2 city that doesn't have any direct international flights. So when flying home, I have to book my international ticket to a tier 1 city like New Delhi or Bombay and then book a separate domestic flight from that city to Bhubaneswar. For international flights, the itineraries with multiple hops within India usually work out to be cheaper but have longer connections. The rule in India is that all passengers travelling internationally have to mandatorily collect their luggages at the port of entry. So when booking my international tickets, I select the cheapest option with multiple hops within India. Once I land at the port of entry, I collect my baggage and check it in for my domestic flight to my hometown, thus skipping all the hops. The rule around collecting luggages at the port of entry allows me to optimize for the both the cost of the ticket and the overall travel time.

5. Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.

As part of my PhD, I set up data collection sites for obtaining 3D scans of pregnant women at four different health centres in Ethiopia. Then, I used this data to train a model that takes a raw 3D scan of a pregnant woman as the input and predicts the 3D shape of that woman at future gestational periods. 

6. Tell us about things you’ve built before. For example apps you’ve built, websites, open source contributions. Include URLs if possible.

To help the nurses collect 3D scans of subjects at the maternal health centers, I built an iOS app that interfaced with the Structure 3D Sensor to acquire and process 3D data on an iPad. This app is currently being used across four health centres in Ethiopia and has helped collect more than 2500 3D scans.

7. List any competitions/awards you have won, or papers you’ve published
