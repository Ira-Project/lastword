4. Please tell us about a time you most successfully hacked some (non-computer) system to your advantage.

	During my time running my non-profit one challenge I constantly faced was having learning facilitators attend team meetings. Despite our best efforts we found the facilitators who were fantastic with children failed to attend the team meetings. When we spoke to them we realised that a lot of the facilitators being from marginalised communities didn't enjoy a lot of personal freedom. Their families, and their communities controlled parts of their life and prevented them from attending these meetings. 
	
	There felt like very little we could do about this situation. There seemed to be no good options. We wanted to support the facilitators and empathise with them but at the same time also ensure we could function effectively. The facilitators had to challenge the power structures and authority figures in their lives themselves.
	
	Rather than being confrontational and directly suggesting this I decided to take a different approach. I gave each of them eight self evaluation questions and asked each of them to reflect. What I had done in this is to include a question on how much the facilitators challenged power structures and authority figures in their lives and in society. The idea was to acknowledge and recognise that this is part of the work that we do and to start the conversation on this.
	
	I found that this approach worked to a great effect. Facilitators shared with one another the challenges they were facing at home and helped support each other in overcoming them. I realised that as a leader the most effective hack is to just start the conversation and ask the right questions rather than looking to solve problems. 

5. Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing other than this startup that you have built or achieved.

	I started a non profit about six years ago to experiment with creating child centric learning spaces where decisions are made by the children. What started with one space has now grown to six spaces and three hundred children. 

6. Tell us about things you’ve built before. For example apps you’ve built, websites, open source contributions. Include URLs if possible.

	Throughout my career I've been building web applications. Outside of the startups listed in my experience I've built a few other applications as well :-
	- An election management application. I built a simple classification model and a Svelte Kit application for a contestant in the Karnataka state election to help them with election strategy. The application classified users based on how likely they were to vote for the candidate and allowed the candidate to plan their campaign accordingly. 
	- Meet Strangers Application. I built and ran a web application where users could sign up and enjoy tea with strangers. 

7. List any competitions/awards you have won, or papers you’ve published

	None
