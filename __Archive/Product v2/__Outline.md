### Purpose

From our user interviews the main pain point for teachers seems to be gauging students' conceptual understanding right after a lecture. Before building on a topic or moving forward they would like to know how much the children have understood. 

We'd like to test how intense this pain point is and if our product can actually solve this for teachers. To test this out we would have to allow teachers to create and share assignments with their classes. We also would need to show or share some analytics to the teacher so they can see the way the class has performed. 

We've also seen how unclear our UI is from our user interviews. Ideally we want our product to be self explanatory to users and simple to understand. This would ensure that we're not getting any noise in the student understanding based on understanding of the product. 

### Principles 
- Simple. Remember the goal is not to build a perfect product on day one but to test our hypothesis and learnings from users. 
- Stable. We want our product to be free of bugs and clear to understand. We do want it to be used in production environments in schools and classrooms so we can get feedback en masse. 

### Brainstorming
- What do I already know about this project? - We have some learnings from the user interview and have built MVPs in the past. 
- What don’t I know that I need to find out? - I'm not confident of getting the UI right. 
- Who can I talk to who might provide insights? - Abu and Dipaq would be good resources to talk to and get good UI insights. 
- What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas? - It might be worth looking into some videos about good UI and UX design.
