### Purpose

We have pilots ready to go and we need to start creating the content for it when school reopens in the Fall. Algebra has been a subject that's common across all the schools. If we can build out the entire Algebra class it would be a lot easier to deploy in the schools and start getting revenue. 

### Principles 

- Flexibility - There are some differences across curriculums in these schools. Not much but there are differences. We need to be in a position to address those easily. 
- Speed - We don't have too much time and ideally we would want to start this at the start of the year for schools. Should try to have something in a month to deploy. 

### Outcome Visioning

Within a month we should have a Algebra classroom with a large concept graph that covers all the concepts. Teachers should be able to choose from a list of 15-20 assignments and start using it in their classrooms. 

### Brainstorming

- What do I already know about this project? We know more or less everything there is to know. It's just about executing it and making it happen. 
- What donâ€™t I know that I need to find out? There is a small aspect of inputting and processing equations that we don't have full clarity on. 
- Who can I talk to who might provide insights? There's not too much to really understand. Maybe can get my mom's input on the concept graph itself in case we want additional opinions.

### Actions

- [ ] Study curriculums and lesson plans of teachers on Algebra 1
- [ ] Create overarching concept graph for all the concepts covered
- [ ] Build a few assignments and test them out
