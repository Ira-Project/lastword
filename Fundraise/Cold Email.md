Subject - Ed Tech for an AI Driven Future - Pre-Seed

Hi ___

Fund specific opening paragraph

Artificial Intelligence has completely changed the way the world works. Our current education system does not provide students with the skills necessary to thrive in the future. 

At Ira Project we're building a suite of tools that helps prepare students for an AI driven future. 

Here's a link to our [deck](https://docsend.com/view/8gfsu4angat4zrdr)

We're currently raising a $500k pre seed. Would you be open to getting on a call? 

Best,

Hi ___ 

We are building tools to help teachers prepare students for an AI driven future. Our founding team has worked in education for the last seven years and has scaled startups to 100k+ users.

Teachers currently use quizzes and worksheets to help find gaps in their students' understanding. Rather than having students answer questions our unique assessments ask students to explain concepts to an AI. 

We are looking to raise a pre-seed round. Here's a link to our deck - https://docsend.com/view/8gfsu4angat4zrdr

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Hi ___ 

We are building the Ira Project a platform that maps studentsâ€™ mental models to generate personalised learning paths. Our founding team has worked in education for the last seven years and has scaled startups to 100k+ users.

School districts in the US purchase 2,591 EdTech tools on an average. 67% of these are unused while 98% of them are not used effectively. By modeling students knowledge state and cognitive styles we help teachers know which apps to use when.

We are looking to raise a pre-seed round and would love to show you what we're building and share our product vision. Here's a link to our deck - https://docsend.com/view/dkz7r2ju38ec6jzj
