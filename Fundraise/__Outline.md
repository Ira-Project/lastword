### Purpose

Our goal is to raise some funding so we can sustain ourselves and build our what we're building. The aim is to raise $250k-$500k diluting less than 10% of the company. 

### Principles 
- Speed - Ideally this shouldn't distract us from building the company. We want to raise quickly so we are ready for the Fall 2024 launch in August. 

### Brainstorming
- What do I already know about this project? - I have been part of a few fundraising experiences and I know the basics but don't know the details. 
- What don’t I know that I need to find out? - The outreach part is always challenging in fundraising. Getting the foot in the door might be the hardest thing and I need to figure out some strategies for this. I also don't know how to approach fundraising in the US at all. 
- Who can I talk to who might provide insights? - Aditya would be a good resource particularly for the funds that invested in them. Vivan would be great for Indian investors and pitch deck feedback. 
- What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas? - YC videos as always would be good resources.
