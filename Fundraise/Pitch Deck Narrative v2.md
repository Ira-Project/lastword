Slide 1
- The ideal student teacher ratio according to numerous experts is 10:1
- Despite best efforts currently it's at 20:1 in many US states and even higher in other countries
- The teacher shortage is only exacerbating this problem
- Academic outcomes are hindered by larger classrooms


Slide 2
- Today's Ed Tech platforms are all addressing this in one of four ways
	- Gamification - Leads to higher engagement
	- Automation - Gives teachers more time
	- Content - For teachers to assign
	- Classroom Management - Handling administrative tasks
- White space
	- There are lots of techniques based on research in education that work only in smaller classrooms. We think AI can allow these to work in larger classrooms as well
	- The best example of this is formative assessment


Slide 3
- We're building a suite of tools that allows teachers to effectively handle larger classrooms without compromising on academic outcomes


Slide 4
- The first of these is the formative assessment tool which serves as a foundation for everything else
- Unlike other formative assessments our tool models the student learning and generates a knowledge graph for every child


Slide 5
- How can teachers use the tool


Slide 6
- Underlying technology 


Slide 7
- What we plan to build on top of this
	- Vertical integration
	- Scaffolded instruction modules
	- Adding STEM and other subjects to build connections across them
	- Peer learning


Slide 8
- Revenue model
	- Schools currently spend $150 per student
	- Charge schools $25 per student
- Typical high school has 750 students of which we can assume 400 will be taking STEM courses
- Allows us to charge schools ~ $10,000
