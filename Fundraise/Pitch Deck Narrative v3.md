Slide 1
- Ira Project
- Modeling student understanding to create personalised learning journeys

Slide 2
- Lots of companies are focused on creating personalised learning but everyone's too busy focused creating more and more content 
	- Public school districts purchase bundles of EdTech apps even now and often struggle to use all the tools they have
- Our goal is to create a way to model student understanding and learning style. With an effective model of student understanding we can recommend the right content from any of the various apps present

Slide 3 - Roadmap

Our first goal is to model student understanding and we're focused on high school math to start with
- Current Teacher Focused
	- Our own assessment tool that models student knowledge
	- Modeling teacher uploaded content with a view to integrate all tools
	- Recommendation to teachers on what to do next
- Next Phase Ed Tech Tool Focused
	- Improving our current tool to aid in data modeling
	- Modeling data from other tools and Ed Tech apps
	- Recommendations on what tools and content from the Ed Tech Apps

Slide 10 - Competitive Landscape
- Typically we can organise knowledge into four quadrants
	- Known Knowns, Known Unknowns, Unknown Knowns and Unknown Unknowns
- Most EdTech companies today are creating content or tools to cater to the top half. More games, more content, more types of learning.
