Hey {First_Name}! A magical solution to help with formative assessments.


Hey {First_Name},
I hope you are having a great day! It’s Vignesh at Ira Project (iraproject.com), and I’m reaching out because I have something that can help assessing your students waayyy easier.  

In short, we make formative assessments that:
1. Help teachers find gaps in students' conceptual understanding
2. Are actually fun for students and build critical thinking abilities
3. Allow students to learn from mistakes and disincentivise cheating

I would love to show you how we can help you better understand students' strengths and weaknesses and really enable them to thrive!

Do you have 20 minutes? What times work for you? Feel free to reply to this email, or you can book a meeting here https://calendly.com/ira-project/demo.

Best, 
Vignesh

Hey {First_Name},

I know you probably get a ton of emails from EdTech companies with the same sales pitch but I promise you we're different! We're not just another AI Ed Tech platform that's built on top of ChatGPT. We've been educators for seven years and built Ira Project to help us in our own classrooms.

I understand if you're skeptical to have a conversation without knowing how the product actually works so here's a demo video to help you understand exactly how our assessments work https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsX8R6AF_zw.

Do let me know if you can spare 20 minutes of your time. I would love to chat and discuss what we're building. You can reply to this email or book a meeting here if it's easier https://calendly.com/ira-project/demo.

Best,
Vignesh
