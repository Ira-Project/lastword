### What geography do we start with?

- US
	- More technology adoption
	- More schools as options
- UK
- India
	- More standardised curriculum
	- Very little technology adoption
	- Less competition

We feel it's probably better to start with US geography. For the US we will start with Atlanta and the Bay Area so there's a high chance that we can visit in person to close the deal. Given there's a higher degree of technology penetration we would be evaluated more correctly and get better feedback as well. 

### What type of school?

- Private schools
- Charter school
- Public school

Our instinct suggests that public schools might require a lot more approval and have a longer sales cycle but we have heard that public schools can work quite well and have sizable budgets for such things. We will reach out to all and split 50% between private/charter and public so we can get an idea on both and what might work better for us. 

### Personas we are reaching out to

- High School Math Teachers -> Second Option
- Technology leaders in schools -> First Option
- School administrators -> Third option

There are two strategies here top down or bottom up. Ideally we would like to try both. Teachers are the ones who might truly feel the pain point and actually get excited by the product so we definitely want to reach out to them. They may also be able to point us on who is the right decision maker. 

Technology leaders are most likely the decision makers for EdTech in schools and understand what different technology does. They may be able to appreciate the difference we have built in to the product and may convert easier. Some schools don't have technology leaders so we're also going to reach out to school administrators who we think might be decision makers. 

### What are we sending exactly?

- The main hook we're going for is finding gaps in conceptual understanding 
- We've also explicitly avoided the usage of AI since we feel that there might be fatigue around this buzzword
- We are also trying to personalise the message so it doesn't feel like a bot has sent it
- See [[LinkedIn Initial Message Outreach Template]]

### CTA in the message

There is no explicit CTA we would seek a manual onboarding here and follow up with a calendly link to the user. For the first few customers we want to be very high touch and also filter for users who might be design partners.

### LinkedIn Qualifier

- Look for people with some history so we know they might check LinkedIn
- Make sure their description makes sense for what we're messaging them about

### Learnings

- Teachers in general are much harder to reach on LinkedIn. The majority of them that are on LinkedIn are looking to make a career transition into a different type of role. Though it's only a sample size of around 30 or so it's still revealing that we got no conversation even. 
- School administrators have been the same as teachers and there have been no hits at all despite reaching out to 30 of them.
- In private and charter schools the response rates are a lot better. Whether it's yes or no we're getting a 25% response rate which is quite good and much higher than anything I've experienced in the past. 
- LinkedIn doesn't work for public schools. Across all roles there has been a very poor response rate.
- The main persona that makes sense on LinkedIn is the private school technology leader. Both our hits have been from there and it's worth going after this persona on LinkedIn.
