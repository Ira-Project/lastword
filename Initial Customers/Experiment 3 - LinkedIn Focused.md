### What geography do we start with?

Global

### What type of school?

- Private schools
- Public schools
- Charter schools
### Personas we are reaching out to

- Technology leaders in schools -> First Option

In this experiment we're controlling primarily for this since we had a higher response rate from this persona. We're continuing to keep other variables broad to see if it was a random chance or is something in this group working better. 

### What are we sending exactly?

- We haven't changed the message from the previous LinkedIn experiment. [[LinkedIn Initial Message Outreach Template]] is what we're continuing

### CTA in the message

There is no explicit CTA we would seek a manual onboarding here and follow up with a calendly link to the user. For the first few customers we want to be very high touch and also filter for users who might be design partners.

### LinkedIn Qualifier

- Look for people with some history so we know they might check LinkedIn
- Make sure their description makes sense for what we're messaging them about

### Learnings
