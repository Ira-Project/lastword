### What geography do we start with?

We will continue the same way as we did in Experiment 1 on LinkedIn and explore a different channel. So we will reach out to personas in Georgia and Bay Area first and then expand from there.

### What type of school?

LinkedIn seems to work fine decently for private schools. So we're hoping that this might be the way to reach out to public schools and charter schools. Having said that we'll try all to see how the response rates are.

### Personas we are reaching out to

Like with LinkedIn we'll do an initial blast to all three personas to understand how they're responding and if it's worth pursuing. 

### What are we sending exactly?

- The main hook we're going for is finding gaps in conceptual understanding 
- We're also including how our assignments disincentivise cheating
- We've also explicitly avoided the usage of AI since we feel that there might be fatigue around this buzzword
- We plan to send a second and third email as well as part of a drip campaign
- See [[Drip Email for Teachers]]

### CTA in the message

There is a calendly link that we'd like teachers to sign up for a demo. However we have also given the option to reply to the email and set up a time. 

### Learnings
- In many schools the librarian seems to be responsible for the education technology decisions
