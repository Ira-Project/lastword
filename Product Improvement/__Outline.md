### Purpose
 
We're starting to get a few pilots going and some conversations are going well for us. What we've also realised is that the product requires some polish to be able to convert these demos to customers. Those who we have spoke to expressed some reservations to take it to their schools and we suspect some of it is because it doesn't feel like a fully finished product. 

It is important to keep in mind that we will continue to reach out to customers and perhaps find some even more early adopters but there does feel like a bit of a balancing act where some amount of product improvement is needed. 

### Principles 

- Building judiciously. This is a dangerous but necessary direction to go in. It's very easy to get into building too much so we need to be cautious about what we build and how much time we spend on it

### Outcome Visioning

There are a few minor things that we can do in the product to give it the impression of being fully classroom ready. Ideally we can spend a week to get this done and future demos will have a higher chance of converting to customers. We should be in a position to give access to those willing to try and not be too worried how it would go. 

### Brainstorming
- What do I already know about this project? There are certain areas already identified in terms of what fixes need to be made
- What don’t I know that I need to find out? I do want to get some design inputs on what I could do to get this looking more finished
- Who can I talk to who might provide insights? Vivan would be the best person to talk about this to but he usually suggests a full overhaul which I don't have time for. Perhaps can ask Harithas for some advice. 
- What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas? I need to check out other more mature products and see how they're doing things and what makes it feel more complete as a product.
